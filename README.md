# Speech to Note 💬📝

## Description 📒
This project will help me put everything together with a new stack i want to test ! And also i wanted to have a web app that will create note with speech :
* The __speaker__ tell things about it's note
* He could also structured it's note with the following speech __point <element> point__
* Those elements could be :
  * Title
  * Sub Title
  * Separator
  * List
  * etc...
* To stop a note, the __speaker__ will need to say __point end point__
* All those command could be updated to other command type
At the end the __speaker__ will be able to review the note and modify it by hand
